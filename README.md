WorkAt frontend project migration - Fulltimeforce

## You have to follow these steps to run the project locally

**First of all, make sure you are using Node `16.14.0` and NPM `8.3.1`, since these are the versions the project runs on.**

Then, once you have that settled, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Head inside the root of the project folder and run the command `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
3. Once that is done, run `npm start` to run the project on `localhost:3000`
